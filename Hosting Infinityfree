Cara Pasang Laravel Di Infinityfree
Our hosting is not really optimized for Laravel and other complex web application frameworks, but I think it’s possible.

To upload Laravel, I think you need to do the following:

    Copy the contents of the public folder to the root directory.
    Install the Composer dependencies.
    Prepare the .env file with all the required settings for your hosting account.
    Upload the Laravel files to the htdocs folder of the domain you want to run it on.

It’s not the prettiest way to do it, but it should work.
